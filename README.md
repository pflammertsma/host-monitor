# Host Monitor

Host Monitor is a simple shell script that monitors if a host is up and responding to ping or not.

Simply execute it with:

    ./host-monitor.sh pixplicity.com
    
The script will remain running until aborted (Ctrl+C), informing you via desktop notifications through `notify-send`.
